    Fun assignment on how to manage states, using redux, and routing.
    A bit new to testing and material design, but it was fun!
    I tried to query the json data using GraphQL to show that I could do that aswell, but the time wasnt sufficient.
    Spent more time than I should setting up a backend that would make use of GraphQL.
    It felt like it was open to translation about how to load the json-files, a bit unclear at that segment.
    I was unsure about if you wanted to add new vehicles and remove vehicles. It just stated you wanted to update the vehicles.
    I also commented out the driver and status, because I was unsure you wanted to display them?
    How to manage the equipments object inside vehicle to display it in a more presentable maner.

    Overall, I thought it was a good test, that wasnt too short and not too long.
